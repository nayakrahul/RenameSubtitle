# RenameSubtitle
To load subtitle into a movie, we have to manually do it using the video player interface. But if the subtitle name matches with the movie name, loading of subtitle is not needed. It is already loaded.

This script renames the subtitle as to match with then movie name.

## Command to run
```python run.py <movies-master-dir-path>```
